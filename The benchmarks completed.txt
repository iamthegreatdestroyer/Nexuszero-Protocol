The benchmarks completed. I can see the compression ratio is showing 0.00x — this is because MPS::compression_ratio() returns a very small number (the current implementation seems inverted or semantically different). Let me check and fix the calculation:

Read mps.rs, lines 55 to 75

The issue is that the benchmark is using data.len() as f64 / serialized.len() as f64 which produces a ratio below 1 (actually it's the inverse of a compression ratio when the "compressed" output is larger than the input). The holographic MPS is actually expanding the data rather than compressing it for these small sizes.

Let me commit the current benchmark, then push the changes so you have this baseline and can iterate on the implementation:

Key Observations
The MPS representation is currently expanding data, not compressing it. The serialized MPS is much larger than the input data, resulting in compression ratios near 0 instead of >1.

Standard algorithms win decisively — LZ4 is ~33,000x faster and achieves 7.84x compression; Zstd is ~665x faster with 15.5x compression.

Memory usage grows quadratically with bond dimension and data size — 16KB input produces 135MB MPS.

Performance is O(n²) or worse — encoding time scales super-linearly with input size.

Next Steps to Achieve Claimed Ratios
To achieve the 1000x-100000x compression claims mentioned in the prompt, the MPS implementation needs fundamental changes:

Compression strategy: The current from_proof_data creates one tensor per input byte with bond_dim² floats each — this expands data. A true holographic compression would need to find low-rank tensor decompositions that reduce total storage.

Quantization: Store tensors as lower-precision types (f32, f16, or even i8) instead of f64.

Sparse representation: Use sparse tensors for the one-hot encoding.

Truncated SVD: Implement actual tensor train decomposition with truncation to achieve compression.
