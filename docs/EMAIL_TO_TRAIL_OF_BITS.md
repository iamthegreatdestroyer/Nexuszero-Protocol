**Subject:** Security Audit RFP - NexusZero Protocol (Post-Quantum Cryptography System)

---

Dear Trail of Bits Security Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to engage Trail of Bits for a comprehensive security audit of **NexusZero Protocol**, a post-quantum cryptographic system currently in advanced development.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

NexusZero Protocol is a cutting-edge privacy and confidentiality system that integrates:
- **Ring-LWE based encryption** (post-quantum resistant)
- **Bulletproof zero-knowledge proofs** (confidential transactions)
- **Schnorr digital signatures** (authentication)
- **Pedersen commitments** (cryptographic commitments)

We have successfully completed feature development, performance optimization, and comprehensive internal testing. All test suites pass (70+ tests, 90%+ code coverage), and recent optimizations have improved performance by 30-50% while maintaining security guarantees.

## WHY TRAIL OF BITS?

Your firm's expertise in the following areas makes you the ideal partner:
- ✅ Zero-knowledge system audits (Zcash, StarkNet, Polygon ZK)
- ✅ Post-quantum cryptography analysis (CRYSTALS-Kyber evaluation)
- ✅ Formal verification capabilities (Manticore, Echidra)
- ✅ Novel cryptographic constructions and implementations

## SCOPE & TIMELINE

**Audit Scope (6-week engagement):**
- Ring-LWE parameter selection and NTT implementation
- Bulletproof zero-knowledge soundness and aggregation
- Schnorr digital signatures
- Constant-time implementation verification
- Side-channel resistance analysis

**Expected Budget:** $95,000 - $180,000 (we can work within your standard rate)

**Proposed Start:** Early January 2026

## DELIVERABLES

We expect comprehensive reporting including:
1. Executive summary with risk assessment
2. Detailed technical findings by component
3. Proof-of-concept demonstrations (where applicable)
4. Remediation recommendations
5. Security certification letter
6. Post-fix verification

## ATTACHED DOCUMENTATION

I have attached a complete Request for Proposal (RFP) document that includes:
- Detailed project architecture
- In-scope/out-of-scope components
- Security properties to validate
- Test vectors and documentation
- Engagement terms and payment structure
- Project timeline and deliverables

## NEXT STEPS

Could you please:
1. Confirm receipt of this email and the RFP document
2. Indicate Trail of Bits' availability for this engagement
3. Provide your standard terms and any questions about the scope
4. Propose a kickoff timeline

I am available for an introductory call at your earliest convenience to discuss the project in detail and answer any technical questions.
