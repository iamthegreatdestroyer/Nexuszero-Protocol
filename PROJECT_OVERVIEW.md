5. **Universal Cross-Chain Privacy Bridge**
   - Atomic privacy swaps between ALL blockchains
   - No wrapped tokens or trusted intermediaries
   - Works with Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Cosmos, etc.

6. **Regulatory Compliance Layer**
   - Prove compliance WITHOUT revealing data
   - Tiered disclosure for regulators/auditors
   - Privacy and regulation coexist harmoniously

7. **Distributed Proof Marketplace**
   - Anyone can earn by generating proofs
   - 95% cost reduction through competition
