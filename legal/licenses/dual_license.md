# Licensing Strategy

This repository uses a dual-licensing approach for illustrative purposes. This is a template—consult legal counsel to determine the best licensing model for your project.

## Proposed Strategy

- **AGPLv3** for personal and open-source distribution.
- **Commercial License** for enterprise customers needing different terms-of-use.

## Implementation Notes

- Public source code is distributed with `AGPL-3.0` by default (see root `LICENSE`).
- A separate `LICENSE_COMMERCIAL.md` can describe commercial terms and contact information.
- Keep meta-data up-to-date in `legal/licenses/` and `README` with links to both license options.

## Example Licensing Header

```text
/*
 * Copyright (c) 2025 [Your Name or Org]. All Rights Reserved.
 *
 * This file is part of DOPPELGANGER STUDIO.
 *
 * Licensed under AGPLv3 for open-source use. Contact [email] for commercial licensing.
 */
```

## Notes

- Do not place confidential licensing deals in the public repository.
- Use a secure contract and vault for business license agreements.
