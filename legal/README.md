# Legal / IP Directory

This folder contains starter legal and Intellectual Property documents for the NexusZero Protocol repository. It is intended to provide guidance and templates that the project owner or legal counsel can use. These materials are not legal advice—consult a qualified attorney for formal filings or opinions.

Structure:

- patents/: Patent-related templates and provisional application notes.
- trademarks/: Trademark application templates and usage guidance.
- licenses/: Licensing strategy and license text references.
- copyrights/: Copyright notice templates and attributions.
- templates/: Reusable header and consent templates for source files.

How to use:

- Add new IP-related documents to the appropriate subfolder.
- Keep any legally sensitive drafts encrypted or in a secure vault; do not commit secrets or private drafts to the repository.
- If you publish any IP filings, add a reference to the public record and version metadata.

Contact:

- For legal questions, involve a qualified lawyer. This is a scaffold only.
